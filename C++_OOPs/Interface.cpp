// The C++ interfaces are implemented using abstract classes and
// these abstract classes should not be confused with data abstraction
// which is a concept of keeping implementation details separate from associated data.

// A class is made abstract by declaring at least one of its functions as pure virtual function.
// A pure virtual function is specified by placing "= 0" in its declaration as follows âˆ’

// public, protected and private inheritance in C++
// public, protected, and private inheritance have the following features:

// public inheritance makes public members of the base class public in the derived class, and the protected members of the base class remain protected in the derived class.
// protected inheritance makes the public and protected members of the base class protected in the derived class.
// private inheritance makes the public and protected members of the base class private in the derived class.
